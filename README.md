## Abstract
Bilinguals are often thought to be better at learning novel words than monolinguals. While we were able to confirm an overall bilingual advantage in a recent meta-analysis, we observed considerable variability, with some studies suggesting a general bilingual advantage extending to all possible word-learning situations and others only showing an advantage under specific conditions. Therefore, we are conducting a highly powered study that compares word learning using the cross-situational statistical learning paradigm between English-German bilinguals and English monolinguals. Participants will learn 1:1 mappings (where one word corresponds to one object) and 1:2 mappings (where one word corresponds to two objects). Unlike previous studies, we will continuously measure learning and closely analyze trial-by-trial behavior to understand subtle learning differences between the language groups. Consistent with previous research, we hypothesize that it will generally be easier to learn 1:1 mappings than 1:2 mappings. More importantly, we predict that bilinguals will outperform monolinguals, specifically in the context of 1:2 mappings, indicating a specific bilingual advantage. Data collection for this study is currently ongoing.
